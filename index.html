<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>This is my html resume! I am really focused on creating a finance
app and this is the first step towards doing that. I have experienced and
learned a lot in my life, but the two biggest factors in my personal development
have been my job as a soccer coach, as well as my self learning journey
in a variety of industries.
